                <p>My name is Joshua Cruz Cintrón, I was born and raised in Puerto Rico. I am a Computer Science and
                    Engineering (CSE) Undergraduate Student at University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez. I enjoy reading
                    philosophy, writing poetry, playing video games, and building software. My goal is to work on small,
                    cross-functional, and interdisciplinary teams to create efficient tools that will help solve problems
                    across multiple domains. I am fascinated by the idea of Agile, and hope to help create and improve
                    agile teams everywhere I set foot. My professional interests are in web development, cloud computing,
                    DevOps, and automation. During my college career I seek the opportunity to learn about these concepts from
                    working on my own projects, and by interning on some of the companies who are most adept at these
                    technologies. All this with the expectation of bringing these technologies to the many teams of developers
                    in Puerto Rico.
